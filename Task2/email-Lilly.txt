Hi Lilly, 

I have attached the benchmarking exercise to this email. 

From the CDP data provided, I have found 35 companies in the automotive industry that have a score greater than, equal to or two scores below Fast Carsâ€™ score of B. Of this total: 

25 companies (roughly 69.4%) score better than Fast Cars (A or A-), 
3 companies (roughly 8.3%) score the same as Fast Cars (B), and 
7 companies (roughly 20%) score one to two scores worse than Fast Cars (B- or C). 

This analysis suggests that Fast Cars is performing worse than the majority of other automotive companies. Therefore, there is room for improvement for Fast Cars to be performing with the top companies. Another idea I had is that we could analyze this data by geographic region to compare to the regions Fast Cars operates in. 

Happy to discuss the results further.

Your name
